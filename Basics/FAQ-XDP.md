XDP is the native token of Dogeparty. It is a technical necessity for adding advanced features to Dogeparty, which by nature require a protocol aware currency. Dogecoin can only be aware of DOGE, while Dogeparty can be aware of both DOGE and XDP itself. This makes it possible to escrow funds, trade in a decentralized manner, and harness the full potential of programmable money.

_Note: It is a common misconception that XDP is a competitor to Dogecoin, when in fact it cannot exist without it. And even though XDP is not a traditional currency, it serves a steady and critical purpose within the Dogeparty ecosystem._

#### How was XDP launched in 2014?

The supply of XDP was created in a process called 'proof-of-burn' that lasted from August 13th to September 17th 2014 (43,200 Dogecoin blocks). During this period, anyone was able to exchange Dogecoins for XDP automatically on a protocol level under the following conditions:

* Users sent their DOGE to a verifiably unspendable Dogecoin address with no known private key via the "burn" process in a dogeparty compatible wallet. ([DDogepartyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxw1dfzr](https://dogeparty.xchain.io/burns))

* Each 1,000 DOGE was automatically exchanged for a number of XDP between 1 and 1.5, with more being rewarded the earlier the burn took place.

* The reward bonus decreased linearily with the block index.

* Each address was limited to 5 Million DOGE.

Since the DOGE on the burn address will never be spendable again, they are considered destroyed or 'burned'. The main advantage of using this process is to create an equal opportunity for all users, including the founders of the project. The result is that nobody started out with a pre-existing supply of XDP. This method is relatively rare in the crypto space, because it did not provide the founders with starting capital. This, however, means that it is a truly decentralized platform similar to Dogecoin's proof-of-work system.

**A truly decentralized system without a crowdfunder has various advantages:**

* Avoids issues with regulatory uncertainty and legal liability because there is no direct profit model, nor a central authority.
* Incentivises developers and users equally.
* Funds are never in the control of any 3rd party.
* Full transparency
* Zero pre-mine

#### How was XDP re-launched in 2021?

The supply of XDP was re-launched in a process called 'proof-of-bern' that lasted from September 1st to November 1st 2021 (86,400 Dogecoin blocks). During this period, anyone was able to exchange Dogecoins for XDP automatically on a protocol level under the following conditions:

* Users sent their DOGE to the community fund Dogecoin address via the "bern" process in a dogeparty compatible wallet. ([DParty4kWgih7MpTUivMn1icgC5x7fxALP](https://dogeparty.xchain.io/burns))
* Each 10 DOGE was automatically exchanged for a number of XDP between 1 and 1.5, with more being rewarded the earlier the burn took place.
* The reward bonus decreased linearily with the block index.
* Each address was limited to 1 Million DOGE.

#### Is XDP an alt-coin or competitor to Dogecoin?

No. XDP cannot exist without Dogecoin, as Dogeparty extends the basic features of Dogecoin with proof-of-publication, oracle betting, decentralized exchange, automatic escrow, and order matching. 

#### Can more XDP be created?

No. The supply of XDP is fixed after the re-launch in 2021, and decreasing because of fees being burned.

#### What is XDP used for?

XDP is the fuel for certain functions within the Dogeparty protocol such as issuing assets and subassets, sweeps, dividends, etc. Appropriately enough, this fuel is **burned** (destroyed). This means that the supply of XDP is continously decreasing. However, the cost of fuel adjusts proportionally as the supply of XDP goes down, so that it cannot reach 0.

XDP is always the easiest token to trade against, as it is represented across all exchanges that support Dogeparty. It is also used for anti-spam fees when registering named tokens, and when making distribution payments to token holders. The betting system also uses XDP.
